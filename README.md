# Coding Power BI
This documentation aims to present the architecture of the repository service **"project-portfolio-dashboards"** in a clear and concise manner, in order to simplify the understanding of all its components and operation. This repository is responsible for storing my learning related to Data Viz and Storytelling with the main market tools.

You will find the Dashboards in the **"Dashboards"** folder. In each folder, you will find:

| Asset | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **.pbix** | Dashboard |
| **README.md** | Documentation |
| **Sources** | All databases used to feed the Dashboard |
| **Assets** | Everything used for the creation of the Template and Dashboard Design |
